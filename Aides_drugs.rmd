#Instructions

Three new preventative aides drugs were tested in clinical trials in 2015. The trial designs were modeled after the famous RV_144 Aides Trials in Tailand in 2009. Our reasearch question: Does sex of the participant seem to be a factor for any of the drugs?


# South Carolina

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.

## Plots
First we will plot the effectiveness of the drug while highlighting the difference of genders. 

```{r}

```


## Numerical

```{r}

```


## Inferential

```{r}

```


# Central Africa

We will subset the data by sex to see if the drug is sex specific.
